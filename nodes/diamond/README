In order to use Diamond on the nodes, you can use the newest version from the
web:
https://github.com/python-diamond/Diamond
They provide files to create RPMs or Debian packages in their repository

One thing that Diamond is currently missing is the sending of timestamps. This
is commonly no problem as at reception of the metrics by the database, a
timestamp is automatically added. Since the InfluxDBRouter might delay the
reception of the metric, it is better to add the timestamp already at the
nodes.
The patch 'diamond_collector.patch' can be used to add this functionality
to Diamond

Diamond provides an output handler for InfluxDB using the python influxdb
package. If there are problems with that handler, you can also use
'influxdbHandlerNative' which uses the urllib2 to send the metrics. It
does not require the installation of any python package, it just uses
stuff from the standard library
