#     User view for jobs in the LMS
################################################################################

The userjobmonitor subscribes itself to a ZeroMQ publisher (like the
one of the InfluxDBRouter) and reacts on signal events. Which event it is can
be configured in the configuration file. The signal event needs to have a status
attribute. If this attribute indicates a job start, a dashboard for the job is
created and added to the user's Grafana account. When it indicates a job end,
the dashboard is only limited in its start and end time, no further changes are
done. Moreover, there is an interval that is used to check all available
dashboards. The userjobmonitor deletes dashboards that are older than a
configurable delete interval, the dashboards are deleted again to tidy up the
user's list of jobs. The user can keep his/her job dashboards by starring them.

Configuration is done in UserJobMonitor.conf. See comments inside there for the
meaning of the options.

Run it simply with userJobMonitor
