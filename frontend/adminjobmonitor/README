#     Admin view for jobs in the LMS
################################################################################

The adminjobmonitor subscribes itself to a ZeroMQ publisher (like the
one of the InfluxDBRouter) and reacts on signal events. Which event it is can
be configured in the configuration file. The signal event needs to have a status
attribute. If this attribute indicates a job start, it creates pictures of
some panels from a dashboard with jobid as template variable and presents one
row for each job on the admin dashboard. At job end, the row is removed again.
The update interval is used to recreate the pictures.

Configuration is done in AdminJobMonitor.conf. See comments inside there for the
meaning of the options.

Run it simply with adminJobMonitor
